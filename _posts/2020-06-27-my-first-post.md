Programming Language Design and Implementation (PDLI) this year was held virtually due to COVID-19. I took this opportunity to attend the conference, but at the same time, I honestly did not expect to get much out of this experience. That is because I thought the conference would be mostly about discussing publications of technical papers by much more experienced people in the field. Hence, I initially thought I’d give it a try and see what kind of work people publish in such a renowned conference as a way to get myself familiar with what I am expected to produce further down the road.

But I was wrong! There were these Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) as well as _Ask Me Anything_ sessions, discussing effective habits for navigating the research landscape and providing opportunities for students to interact with researchers in the field, among other things. In some of these sessions, experienced, senior people were genuinely sharing their research experiences and other stories of building their (research) career in non-technical, everyday English, which was enlightening and encouraging for early-stage graduate students like me. What I enjoyed the most was the Slack’s `#mentoring` channel, where attendees could reach out to volunteer mentors and have 1:1 meetings. Through the channel, I could talk to 14 people in total – either professors, professionals or PhD students. I enjoyed these individual meetings so much that I decided to write a blog post about it and share with anyone who might be interested. Below are their responses to the questions I asked.

### Question 1: What are some good ways to come up with research topics, especially for junior PhD students? How can I figure out what I am interested in?

### Answers:
- Many advisors do not expect their 1st year PhD student to come up with original research topic(s). They may offer you some options and let you work on one of them. It is recommended that you work closely with your advisor or other senior students (if possible) for the initial projects, so you learn how the process works.

### Question 2: What are some useful techniques when it comes to reading papers?

### Answers:
- ...


Overall, what I found truly amazing was that all the people I’ve talked to, without any exception, were genuinely encouraging and very much willing to help. It felt as if they were freely offering their service, without expecting anything in return. Almost all the professors and PhD students I’ve talked to mentioned that I can reach out to them anytime in the future, if I need their help. I personally do not know much about how other CS (or non-CS) fields are like. But I was so touched by such culture and have this feeling that, going forward, I will come to appreciate being part of the PL community even more.

Lastly, I would like to thank my advisor, _Ilya Sergey_, for encouraging me to reach out to mentors via PLDI #mentoring, as well as the following professors, professionals, and PhD students for their guidance:
_Karim Ali_, _Benjamin Delaware_, _Ranjit Jhala_, _Jeehoon Kang_, _Paulette Koronkevich_, _Lindsey Kuper_, _Santosh Nagarakatte_, _Mangpo Phothilimthana_, _Nadia Polikarpova_, _Roopsha Samanta_, _Kartik Singhal_, _Manu Sridharan_, _Emma Tosch_, _Xinyu Wang_
